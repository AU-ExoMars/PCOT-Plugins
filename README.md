## RIM Dewarping
Takes a HRC image of the Rover Inspection Mirror (RIM) and reprojects it to correct the distortion. Currently it only work on a test image (if you want this ask me, I'm not sure I have permission to release it) as it uses hardcoded values... but the plan is to have it take two clicks for the user: centre of the mirror and edge of the mirror, and use those values to run the rest of it.
